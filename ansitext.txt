Is the U.S. on track to become more or less dependent on
imported oil?

- For the next few decades, the answer is actually less. 
The Energy Information Administration (part of the US Dept.
of Energy) believes the U.S.  will need to import 45% of
its petroleum in 2035.  

- That decrease is attributed mostly to an expected rise in
bio fuels, like ethanol.  

But,

- Many experts point out that by 2035 oil prices could be
significantly higher.  

- This, as the world depletes the most easy-to-reach oil
reserves and may need to use much more energy (and more
funds) to reach remaining sources.  

- And as supply may become harder to manage, world oil
demand is expected to keep rising.  Countries which now
export oil may begin to export less and keep more supply
for their own use.
